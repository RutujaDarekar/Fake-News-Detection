# Fake-News-Detection
Fake news has become a serious problem in recent years, with the potential to cause widespread harm and damage public trust in journalism. Natural language processing (NLP) and deep learning techniques have shown promise for detecting fake news by analyzing the language used in news articles.

In this project, we aim to develop a model for fake news detection using NLP and deep learning techniques. We will collect a dataset of news articles labeled as real or fake, and train a model to recognize patterns in the language used in these articles. The model will be validated on a separate test set, and its performance will be evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. The goal of this project is to provide a reliable and efficient tool for identifying fake news, which could help journalists, fact-checkers, and the general public distinguish between reliable and unreliable sources of information.
